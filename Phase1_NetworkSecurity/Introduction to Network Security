TASK #1 

Introduction to Network Security Monitoring: (NSM) is a critical aspect of Cybersecurity that involves continues observation and analysis of network traffic.
it is the process of collecting, analyzing and responding to network traffic and events to detect and mitigate security threats.

 Common NSM Techniques includes;
 - Signature Base detections
 - Anomaly Detection
 - Behavioral Analysis

Packets: In computer networking,a packet is the basic unit of data transmitted over a network. It contains the data being sent, along with information about the source and destination of the data, and other control information. 
Packets are broken down into smaller pieces for transmission and reassembled at the destination. 

Protocol: A protocol is a set of rules and conventions governing communication between devices on a network. It defines how data is formatted, transmitted, and received.
Examples of protocols include TCP/IP, HTTP, FTP, and SMTP.

Intrusion Detection System (IDS): An IDS is a security tool that monitors network traffic and system activities for signs of malicious activity or policy violations. 
It analyzes network traffic, system logs, and other data sources to detect anomalies and potential threats. 

Firewalls: A firewall is a security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on a set of security rules. It acts as a barrier between a private network and a public network,
such as the internet, to protect against unauthorized access and attacks.
