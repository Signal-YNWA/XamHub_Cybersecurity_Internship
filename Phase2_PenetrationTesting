TASK #1

               INTRODUCTION TO PENETRATION TESTING

Pen-Testing is a simulated cyber attack conducted on a computer system or network to identify and assess vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors.

Processes of Penetration Testing 

 1. Planning & Reconnaissance  
 2. Scanning & Vulnerability Assessment 
 3. Exploitation 
 4. Post Exploitation 
 5. Reporting 

  Types of Penetration Testing 

1. Black Box --> Here the Tester has no prior knowledge of the target system 
2. White Box --> Here the tester has detailed knowledge 
3. Gray Box  --> Here the tester has limited knowledge 

   Benefits 

1. Identity Vulnerability 
2. Assess Security 
3. Compliance &  Risk Management 
4. Improve Security Awareness 

   Two Phases 
1) Reconnaissance: In this phase the tester gather information about the target system 
2) Vulnerability Exploitation: In this phase the tester attempts to exploit identified vulnerability to gain unauthorized access



TASK #2

              SETTING UP THE ENVIRONMENT FOR PENETRATION TESTING 

 > Download Metasploit and Nmap for this and i set it up for penetration testing, Vulnerability Assessment and Scanning and Reconnaissance 




TASK #3

                   RECONNAISSANCE:

  > This Refers to the process of gathering information about a target system, organization or individuals 

it has 2 types which are ; 
    ~ Active : involves direct interaction with the Target system 
    ~ passive: involves gathering information without interacting directly 



TASK #4 

                SCANNING AND VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT 

    > are critical processes in identifying, analysing and mitigating security risk with systems, network, applications 

    Types 

      ~  Network Scanning 
      ~  Port Scanning 
      ~  Service Scanning 
      ~  Vulnerability
