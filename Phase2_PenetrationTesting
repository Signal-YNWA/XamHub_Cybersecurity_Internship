     Introduction To Penetration Testing

Pen-Testing is a simulated cyber attack conducted on a computer system or network to identify and assess vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors.

Processes of Penetration Testing 

 1. Planning & Reconnaissance  
 2. Scanning & Vulnerability Assessment 
 3. Exploitation 
 4. Post Exploitation 
 5. Reporting 

  Types of Penetration Testing 

1. Black Box --> Here the Tester has no prior knowledge of the target system 
2. White Box --> Here the tester has detailed knowledge 
3. Gray Box  --> Here the tester has limited knowledge 

   Benefits 

1. Identity Vulnerability 
2. Assess Security 
3. Compliance &  Risk Management 
4. Improve Security Awareness 

   Two Phases 
1) Reconnaissance: In this phase the tester gather information about the target system 
2) Vulnerability Exploitation: In this phase the tester attempts to exploit identified vulnerability to gain unauthorized access
